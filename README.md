# Recursion
Recursion is a technique in computer science where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as traversing and manipulating data structures, generating mathematical sequences, and solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems. A recursive function is a function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly, as part of its execution. The function's execution is divided into two cases: the base case and the recursive case. The base case is the simplest form of the problem that can be solved directly, and the recursive case is the more complex form of the problem that is solved by breaking it down into one or more sub-problems, which are then solved recursively. Recursive functions are used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems. These sub-problems are then solved by the same function, with the solution to each sub-problem being used to solve the next. This process continues until the base case is reached, at which point the function stops calling itself and returns the final solution.Recursive functions are typically more efficient and less error-prone than iterative solutions because they take advantage of the problem's natural recursive structure. However, they can also consume a significant amount of memory due to the overhead of multiple function calls and they also require a clear base case or else it will lead to infinite recursion.
CLASS sierpinskiCarpet

 the Sierpinski Carpet class uses recursion to generate a fractal pattern made up of repeating squares within squares. The class has two functions, makeEmpty and create, that work together to achieve this.The makeEmpty function takes in the current size of the square and its position in the carpet array and empties the middle square of that size. The create function, on the other hand, takes in the carpet array, the position of the current square, and its size. It first calls the makeEmpty function to empty the middle square and then checks if the current size is less than or equal to one. If it is, the function exits. If not, the function divides the current square into nine smaller squares and calls itself on each of these smaller squares. In this way, the create function keeps dividing the square into smaller squares, emptying the middle square of each, until it reaches the base case where the square is less than or equal to one. This is how the fractal pattern is generated. The main function of this class is also using recursion by calling the create function multiple times, each with different size of carpet and printing the result of each with print function.
